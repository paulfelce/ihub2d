Click anywhere to start
</br>
</br>
Click again to draw a wall. (Note, I've tested by starting in top left and first wall is left to right.)
</br>
</br>
Right click to enter an exact (mm) measurement before starting another wall
</br>
</br>
Click below (or above) a horizontal wall for a corner and perpendicular wall.
</br>
</br>
Click in line with a wall to creating an opening and in line again to continue the wall after the opening
</br>
</br>
Note, you can't create a corner from an opening
</br></br>
Press delete to delete a wall(can't delete the first wall)
</br></br>
When you get back to the start point , click the green square to complete the diagram.
(Once clicked, you can no longer edit)
</br></br>
Click Save to "Save the current diagram"
</br></br>
Click "choose file" to select a file to load. Then Load . This needs a bit of work but should be sorted very soon.
